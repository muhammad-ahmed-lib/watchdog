    override fun onErrorCaptured(report: CrashReport) {
      
        Log.d("WatchDog", "onErrorCaptured: $report")
   
    }
}

WatchDogActivityBuilder(
   
    appContext = this,
  
    behaviour = watchDogBehaviour,
   
    watchDogEventListener = watchDogEventListener,
   
    title = "App Crashed",
